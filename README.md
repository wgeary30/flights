✈️ FlightMemory Scraper
A Python project that scrapes flight history from FlightMemory and cleans the data into a structured format for analysis.

* flightcleaner.py — Cleans and processes the raw CSV data (dates, times, durations).
* flightdata.py — Defines a FlightData enum for standardized column names and table indexes.
* flights.csv — The raw scraped data (ignored in .gitignore if sensitive).
* user.json — Contains login credentials (not tracked in Git for safety).
